# SiteWhere Node-RED interface application

Sample Application for SiteWhere uplink and downlink communication.

## Prerequisites

* SiteWhere setup
* Node-RED setup

## Setup

Having atleast 3.5.x version of npm installed is needed.
* If you are using it in raspberry pi then copy flows_raspberry.json at .node-red/ and you are done.
* If you are using any other system, change json file name to flows_<system_name>.json. Most probably you
will find this default file which you need to replace.
* Caution!! Keep in mind that all your old flows will be lost.

### What is not mentioned here
All the setup guide described with consideration that you already have prior experience with relevant projects. If you are new to any of these, it is very important to go through and understand at first.
